  abstract = {There is a growing need for automated systems that can interview patients
	and consumers about their health and provide health education and
	behavior change interventions using natural language dialog. A number
	of these health dialog systems have been developed over the last
	two decades, many of which have been formally evaluated in clinical
	trials and shown to be effective. This article provides an overview
	of the theories, technologies and methodologies that are used in
	the construction and evaluation of these systems, along with a description
	of many of the systems developed and tested to date. The strengths
	and weaknesses of these approaches are also discussed, and the needs
	for future work in the field are delineated.},
