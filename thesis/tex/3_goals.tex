% soll hier noch gesagt werden, dass wir davon ausgehen, dass es keine endzustï¿½nde gibt?

Based on the purpose of bringing the healthcare applications of the University of Auckland's healthcare project and certain safety standards closer together, and thereby to lay the foundation of aspired safety certifications, Robostudio should be extended with essential tools for this purpose. The visual programming environment is used for developing robotic applications in the form of state machines and shall provide a new interface in the future, which can be used by developers for evaluating safety properties of robot behaviour. On the one hand, this extension shall be seamlessly integrated in Robostudio. On the other hand, it should provide a clear API which allows easy integration also into other program environments. Thus, the new concepts are to be universal and not confined to Robostudio.

The goal is to introduce a visual language for defining safety constraints in state machine definitions of robot behaviour, that is suitable for people who are not experts in formal methods. The visual language should be easy to use and intuitive to read, in order to facilitate maintainability.
Hence, the graphical formalism should abstract from the usually complex and mathematical concept of conventional temporal logic but still be significantly expressive.
 
Furthermore some mechanism should be integrated aiming to support users in finding suitable constraints for a certain application. It is assumed that applications are modeled by state transition graphs. This modeling paradigm is used in many healthcare robots that employ dialogue systems for communicating with users~\cite{Bickmore2006}. Other possible fields might be shop assistant robots or entertainment robots. For such systems, the approach is suitable. It is based on heuristically analyzing state transition graphs and deriving constraints related to the graph structure. This work investigates a particular heuristic as a first step towards user support. 

Finally, this heuristics will be applied to the medication reminder example mentioned before in order to retrieve meaningful results. The minimum goal that should be achieved is the identification of the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The application will always eventually check the database for new reminder jobs. Thus it is ensured that pending reminders are processed.
%	\item Either a reminded medication is taken properly, or caregivers are notified that the patient refused medication intake.
	\item Whenever there is a pending reminder, medication will be finally taken or caregivers will get notified in case of the patient refusing medication intake.
% The next item is left out so that we can say, our heuristic found one we didn't think about yet :)
%	\item During the medication intake process the program can not switch to other services such as entertainment mode ore blood pressure measurement, for example.
\end{itemize}

Some of the statements do not make sense if patients lie or pretend to take their medication but don't take it. As the presented approach validates state machine behaviour rather than human attitudes, it is assumed that there is either cooperation from the patient or a separate tool that can verify medication intake. Furthermore the correctness of external services used by the medication reminder such as the database module holding all reminders is not taken into account.

All the functionality mentioned above shall be combined in one editor and for evaluation purpose later be integrated into Robostudio, a programming environment for state machine editing.
